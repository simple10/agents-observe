## FUTURE TASKS

Don't implement these yet. They're here for future reference.

- [ ] Add a toggle icon in top right of Top Nav for a Logs view
  - Logs view should just show the raw events and payloads for the selected project or session
  - User can toggle between the "normal" view and raw logs
  - Logs should still have a bit of formatting to clearly show the raw event name "PreToolUse", etc. but then have the payloads auto expanded - no summary, no timeline, no deduping, just raw events and payloads
